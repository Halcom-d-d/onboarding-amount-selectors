# Account Selectors  
## Halcom Practical Assignement (Junior / Mid)

The account selector has two input fields that allow users to filter the transaction data logged to her / his / their bank account.
1) Make the fields editable so that user may enter only digits and . for fractional part of the amount.
2) When the user moves away from the input field, format the amount using thousand separators and two digits representing the fractional amount.
3) When the user submits the form, validate that amountFrom is actually lower than the amountTo and update the parent component state with new filter values. If, incorrect, place focus on the amountTo input field.

Bonus points:
- Implement a toggle button for sorting mocked transaction data! :) 
- Unit test the validation rules and formatting rules!! :) :)
